My ok-ish LaTeX template for University of Waterloo Engineering Work Reports

The template is designed to meet the requirements of University of Waterloo Engineering Faculty, though I specificially was following the Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering guidelines since I'm in Mechanical Engineering. If you use my template, make sure you tailor it to meet your needs.

There's some lorem ipsums lying around, they appear as \lipsum or \lipsum[2] or similar. They're for the sake of showing what the formatting will look like. Obviously delete them for your report.

There's an example of a figure and an in-text citation in the example section. I plan to add more examples (numbered and un-numered equations, tables, etc)

For proper IEEE reference styling you will want to use the IEEEtran bibliography style, I may update the template eventually to help make that easier. I used a bibliography manager called Jabref when I wrote my report.

This template was used to get an outstanding on my third work report :)
