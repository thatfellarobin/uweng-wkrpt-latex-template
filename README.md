My ok-ish LaTeX template for University of Waterloo Engineering Work Reports

I wrote this LaTeX template in about a day and a half, starting from 0 LaTeX knowledge. This explains why it's probably somewhat sketchy in some areas. To use it, you should only require a basic knowledge of LaTeX (really simple things that can be googled).

The template is designed to meet the requirements of University of Waterloo Engineering Faculty, though I specificially was following the Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering guidelines since I'm in Mechanical Engineering. If you use my template, make sure you tailor it to meet your needs.

There's some lorem ipsums lying around, they appear as \lipsum or \lipsum[2] or similar. They're for the sake of showing what the formatting will look like. Obviously delete them for your report.
There's an example of a figure and an in-text citation in the example section. I plan to add more examples (numbered and un-numered equations, tables, etc)

I use BibDesk to manage bibliography entries, but for the sake of the template I have "bibfile.bib' which has an example bibliography entry. You'll want to replace this with something else, obviously. BibDesk came with MacTeX, which is the distribution I used to install LaTeX. For an editor, I use Atom with two LaTeX packages: one which allows me to build pdf from inside Atom, and one which handles syntax highlighting.

If you have suggestions to improve the template with best practices, I'm happy to hear them.
