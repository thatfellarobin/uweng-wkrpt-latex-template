My shitty LaTeX template for University of Waterloo Engineering Work Reports

I wrote this LaTeX template in about a day and a half, starting from 0 LaTeX knowledge. This explains why it's probably somewhat shitty in some areas.

The template is designed to meet the requirements of University of Waterloo Engineering Faculty, though I specificially was following the Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering guidelines since I'm in Mechanical Engineering. If you use my template, make sure you tailor it to meet your needs.

I use BibDesk to manage bibliography entries, but for the sake of the template I have "bibfile.bib' which has an example bibliography entry. You'll want to replace this with something else, obviously.

If you have suggestions to improve the template with best practices, I'm happy to hear them.
