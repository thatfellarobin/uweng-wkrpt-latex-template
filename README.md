My ok-ish LaTeX template for University of Waterloo Engineering Work Reports

The template is designed to meet the requirements of University of Waterloo Engineering Faculty, though I specificially was following the Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering guidelines since I'm in Mechanical Engineering. If you use my template, make sure you tailor it to meet your needs.

There's a few examples inside about figures, equations, citations, cross-referencing. It's pretty much the basics. Tables are annoying but still relatively simple, just look up a few examples online and you'll be on your way.

I used a reference manager called JabRef when I wrote my report, I found it dealt with IEEE pretty well. Use the IEEEtran reference type.

This template was used to get an outstanding on my third work report :)
